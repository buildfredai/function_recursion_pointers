# Functions, Recursion, and Pointers Practice (C)

This directory contains practice programs based on **functions**, **recursion**, and **pointers** in the C programming language.  
The focus is on understanding **logic flow, memory behavior, and function calls** clearly.

---

## Topics Covered

### Functions
- Function declaration, definition, and call
- Passing arguments (call by value)
- Returning values
- Multiple functions in a program
- User-defined functions

### Recursion
- Base condition and recursive case
- Stack behavior in recursion
- Common recursive problems (factorial, sum, power, digits)
- Difference between recursion and iteration

### Pointers
- Pointer declaration and initialization
- Address (`&`) and dereference (`*`) operators
- Passing variables using pointers
- Pointers with functions
- Basic pointer arithmetic
